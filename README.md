# AMICoin Desktop GUI Wallet

## Graphical user interface wrapper for the AMICoin command line tools

This program provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the AMICoin client tools that acts as a wrapper and 
presents the information in a user-friendly manner.


**This wallet is targeted at advanced users who understand the implications of running a full AMICoin node on**
**the local machine, maintaining a full local copy of the blockchain, maintaining and backing up the**
**AMICoin nodes's `wallet.dat` file etc! The wallet is not suitable for novice crypto-currency users!**

**SECURITY WARNING: Encryption of the wallet.dat file is not yet supported for AMICoin. Using the wallet** 
**on a system infected with malware may result in wallet data/funds being stolen. The**
**wallet.dat needs to be backed up regularly (not just once - e.g. after every 30-40**
**outgoing transactions) and it must also be backed up after creating a new Z address.**

**STABILITY WARNING: The GUI wallet is as yet considered experimental! It is known to exhibit occasional stability problems related to running a full AMICoin node.**
**Specifically if the locally running `amicoind` cannot start properly due to issues with the local blockchain, the GUI cannot start either!**
**Users need to be prepared to fix such problems manually**
**Doing so requires command line skills.**
